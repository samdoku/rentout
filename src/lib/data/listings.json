We are a short walk from 2 lovely parks and lots of cafes, bars and resturants. Crouch End, Highgate and Hampstead are within easy reach. And we are close to brilliant transport links.  It's especially easy and very quick to get to Kings Cross St Pancras and into the West End. \r\nWe often go to Wales during school holidays to visit family and friends and we're happy for people to stay in our house while we're away. \r\nWe love our house and have been slowly but surely renovating it.  We hope you love it too!",

Well Street Common in front of our house joins directly with Victoria Park, great for long walks, sports and a picturesque lake side caf\u00e9. The park is by a canal which runs along to Islington and Camden Town in one direction and to Stratford and the Olympic Village in the other.  East London provides a number of weekend markets, most of which are walking distance from the house including: Broadway Market, Columbia Road Flower Market, Spitalfields, Brick Lane. Entertainment is also close by including Hackney Empire, Hackney Picturehouse, London Fields Lido, boating on the lake in Victoria Park and plenty of gyms and fitness classes in and around the park. A variety of festivals take place in the park throughout Summer.",

Our nearest station is Mile End (Central, District, Hammersmith & City lines) a short bus ride from the house and we're also walking distance from Homerton and Hackney Central overland stations. The West End can be accessed in 25 mins. Canary Wharf is a 20 minute bus ride from our house.",
			"access": "The kitchen is available for refreshments only. Use of it for cooking will be considered depending on length of stay. As will use of the washing machine and tumble dryer. The house is no smoking but you are welcome to smoke in the garden. All living areas are accessible to guests (excluding the other bedrooms), however we would request that guests respect our privacy in the sitting room at times we are home during an evening or working from home. We can discuss this at the time of booking. If we are out or away then guests may use the sitting room at their leisure.",
			"interaction": "If we are at home during your stay, we will be available to assist you and to answer any questions that you have about your stay and the area but will mainly keep to ourselves other times. If away, you will be met by a friend of ours who lives locally. Of course if we are away, which is quite probable while you're staying, then dog and baby will also be away. Our baby is six months old and sleeps in her own nursery next to our room. She is a happy content little thing and sleeps through the night. Of course, as with all babies, there are occasional tears but these are usually fairly short lived. Oskar the dog is a small king charles spaniel x terrier and has an easy going temperament, is well trained and well behaved. He will interact playfully and enthusiastically with anyone who would like to be his friend. If you do not want him visiting your room then please keep the door closed.",
